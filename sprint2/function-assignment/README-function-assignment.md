Functions: 

A useful image to look at for different types of functions:


// A named function:

function triple (x) {
return x * 3
}


// An anonymous function assigned to a variable:

const triple = function (x) {
return x * 3
}


// An anonymous fat arrow function assigned to a variable:

const triple = (x) => {
return x * 3
}


Looking at the THREE different types of functions that are outlined in the picture above, 
create your own examples that could be used to show the difference between them.
